    God, it takes so long to set up all the webpack stuff. There's probably a better way to do it that I just missed, whatever. Now have the dev server running, so seeing updates might even be more convenient than it was without webpack at all. Pretty sick.

    So this is gonna be a slightly bigger project than the restaurant page. I'm thinking maybe three days, four max. Shouldn't be all that hard to set up a basic to-do list. After that, I'm adding a little lady friend similar to kurippi from whichever project she was in. I was gonna make this an rpg style to-do list, but those already exist, so I want something slightly more unique. Similar concept here, but the gameification is through a dating sim instead. Super basic though. No dialogue, just a gift system, a currency, and some emotions from Loretta maybe. That's her name btw.

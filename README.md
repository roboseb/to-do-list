    God, it takes so long to set up all the webpack stuff. There's probably a better way to do it that I just missed, whatever. Now have the dev server running, so seeing updates might even be more convenient than it was without webpack at all. Pretty sick.

    So this is gonna be a slightly bigger project than the restaurant page. I'm thinking maybe three days, four max. Shouldn't be all that hard to set up a basic to-do list. After that, I'm adding a little lady friend similar to kurippi from whichever project she was in. I was gonna make this an rpg style to-do list, but those already exist, so I want something slightly more unique. Similar concept here, but the gameification is through a dating sim instead. Super basic though. No dialogue, just a gift system, a currency, and some emotions from Loretta maybe. That's her name btw.

    Things are going pretty well. Started adding more of the basic funcitonality you'd expect from a to-do list program. No major bugs or issues today, until I tried adding a bunch of line breaks to the displayed tasks. They all get ignored but the last one, and every time I google it I only get results for people trying to have their output match my issue. 

    Classic, "fixed it, but I have no idea what the issue was." Instead of adding new lines to the inner text, I just made a variable that I would add to and the set the inner text to the variable. Works great. Don't know why I needed it.

    Another pretty solid day. I was able to quickly fix the remove project button, which was not working properly at the end of my time yesterday. Also added a checkbox for tasks, which required slighly reworking a few things, but it's pretty solid now.
